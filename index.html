        <h2>SKILLS</h2>

        <p>C++, C#: I have used both of these languages to make small prototype games, ranging from a text-based adventure to a
            3D grappling-based game.</p>

        <p>HTML, CSS: I have used these to create the website you're currently viewing.</p>

        <p>Unreal Engine: I have used up to version 4.27 and have about a year and a half of experience working with its
            built-in blueprints and using C++ to create my own scripts.</p>

        <p>Unity: I have over ten years of experience in this game engine. I have created several small prototypes for
            mechanics, such as a grappling hook swinging game where you try to move from point to point in a set time, a Call
            of Duty zombie-styled survival game, and my favorite, a small survival game prototype that included a player
            manager, inventory, stats, crafting, enemies, and object placement in the world.</p>
